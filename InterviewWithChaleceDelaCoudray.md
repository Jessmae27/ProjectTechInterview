# Interview with Chalece DelaCoudray from CEISMC

### By Jessica Maebius

In today’s society, the role of music technology in the field of education and curriculum increases every day. To talk more about a career at this intersection I brought in Chalece DeLaCoudray who has experience facilitating, creating, and teaching music technology, especially at a high school level. She currently works at Codio as a Computer Science Curriculum Developer full time as well as at Georgia Tech’s Center for Education Integrating Science, Mathematics, and Computing (CEISMC) as a STEAM Curriculum Integration Specialist at Lovejoy High School part-time. She got her undergraduate degree in Music Technology at Bethune-Cookman University then worked in the music industry as an audio engineer before coming to Georgia Tech to get her Master of Science in Music Technology. She also has worked with Amazon Future Engineers and Georgia Tech in the facilitation of the Earsketch program, in particular on the Your Voice is Power curriculum. 


Interview on November 16, 2021:

**What would you say are your key roles and responsibilities of your job?**

*My jobs and responsibilities include creating curriculum especially for online courses in the area of computer science. Right now, I’m working on one for introductory operational systems.*
*My tasks include gathering information and research on subjects and creating educational programs that helps students get the material but also put it in a platform that allows them to engage with the material at the same time. There’s lots of research involved and strangely a lot of coding involved because the platform that we use is an in-house platform for the company.*

**What coding languages do you use?**

*Python, C, HTML, JavaScript*

**Can you describe some of your past projects with CEISMC?**

*This is my third year at CEISMC. I’ve been at Lovejoy for all three years but last year we were virtual, and we built a playlist mobile app across four classrooms. We had the music classroom, computer science, audio-visual, and visual arts. We kind of traded subjects pretty much and let the visual arts students take what they were studying and share it with the other classes and used that model to take everybody’s work and create a mobile app. The students also created their own cover art inspired by the artists they were studying in class. It was super fun!*

**What is the best/worst part of your job? **

*The best part of my job is that I get to learn a lot. I’m a learner and I like to learn a lot of new things. When I get to learn something that I don’t know and then apply it and be like “Ooh this works!” that’s probably my favorite part. It’s just nice to be picking up something new and then in a couple of days I’ll be working and have a functional knowledge of it.*
*The worst part is having to work against tight deadlines. And sometimes when you’re creating content or curriculum, especially for computer science, it’s hard to know what to leave out and what to include. Sometimes you’ll think “oh this can go,” and then two modules later you’ll actually need that thing. But just working against those deadlines and figuring out the sweet spot of what to let go, what to shorten, and what to keep is probably the worst part.*

**Is this common in the field of education?**

*Yes, very much so. Especially in public schools, deadlines are your worst enemy because everybody wants a testing deadline for you, everybody wants metrics from you, everybody wants from you, but in public schools in particular you don’t get a lot of resources to supply everyone with those needs and wants. As far as public schools go, just having to meet those deadlines and be creative when there are no resources is not the most fun.*

**How did you end up in this position?**

*I was at CEISMC for three years and I was just trying to move on into that next phase, and I wanted to be a better programmer. I didn’t start out as a computer scientist or a technologist or anything. I was a musician, so I was really looking for a career where I could be effective at the technical level that I am now, which isn’t slight, but it isn’t amazing either, and still be able to improve at the things I wasn’t great at. Building curriculum about stuff that you’re not a master at is a great way to do that because you have to learn to be able to teach. I kind of found Codio just on Indeed and they were pleased with the work I had done with CEISMC and my work with them bled over into a project with Amazon Future Engineer and Georgia Tech where we created a whole other musically centered curriculum and were able to launch an international competition with Earsketch. So after that, Codio said that I look like someone they would be interested in.*

**What do you hope to accomplish in your future career?**

*I’m actually at a bit of a crossroads right now. I have one side in the field of education which is kind of a continuation of what we did with the Your Voice is Power program last year, and on the other side is a music company recruiting me for a position. Long-term, I do want to transition more into the music and music technology industry with something with Audio DSP as I get more practice, but for now I am very happy with what I’m doing in education and music technology education especially. I’m very pleased with what my career has turned into so far!*

**Can you describe your role with Earsketch?**

*I guess I can call myself an Earsketch master facilitator at this point. I just did something in Savannah this past weekend which was the launch for the next iteration of the You Voice is Power program. So basically, I train teachers on how to use the curriculum, how to use Earsketch in the curriculum, and to go through the program. I also train students on Earsketch. The project was a nice fit of course because I was an audio engineer and a producer and now I can code and I have the technical skills, so putting those two together and making Earsketch sound like it came out of a studio or like it could be on the radio is a big pull right now for a lot of teachers who are trying to interest their students. A lot of students want to be producers and artists and all these things, so being able to connect the dots between what Earsketch can do and it’s relevance to the career (like how in the music industry it’s relevant to be able to code) is the space that I’m in.*

**What skills did you learn on the job?**

*I’ve become much better at version control on the job. When I was actually at Georgia Tech I wasn’t great at it. I would always be like “can you come help me do this Github thing,” but I’m much better at it now. I’m also actually a lot better at testing, especially unit testing in code, and I’ve generally become a better coder. I can sift through and analyze educational and technical data much better.*

**What role do you see music technology having in the field of education?**

*This is an interesting question to ask right now because I’m getting a lot of requests and interaction on teachers wanting to pull me in as someone who has had a career in the music industry and who is technology adept and basically, they want their students who are into music tech to get them into technology which is a strange relationship. I feel like people are cheating music right now a little bit to get students into technology. They’re kind of doing music dirty, so I feel like we need to find that really sweet balance between teaching not only the music theory but also the math behind it with all the calculus involved. We care a lot about math. We care a lot less about music. But once you make that connection that you can do music in calculus and have a bomb career, once we find that sweet spot, music technology can have a much bigger role in the education space.*

**What advice do you have about working with students?**

*I would say if you’re working directly with students, relationship building is very important because what the students are willing to do for you isn’t always for themselves. A lot of times the students are in it to gain approval from the teacher or from their parents, so their motivations aren’t very intrinsic.*
*But working with students building a relationship, finding out what they like, finding out what they don’t like, having conversations that don’t have to do with work all the time and then using that to inform how to interact with them in the classroom is probably the most helpful thing you can do. For me I just so happen to be an open nerd and I love anime and it’s the most amazing thing right now that high schoolers and middle schoolers love anime, so I connect with my students through that. We’ve had many a Naruto lessons, many a One Piece lessons and they’re teaching the same things but the students are listening a lot more because I’m talking about something that they’re familiar with, and that they like, and that they go home and watch when they don’t have to work. That goes a long way for getting students to interact, getting them to do assignments, and getting them to turn things in. If I can’t connect with you, I can’t teach you anything.*

As someone pursuing a career in education with a major in music technology, my interview with Chalece was extremely valuable. Her past projects that incorporate music into computer science curriculums are a great example of the way that music technology can engage students and act as tools for teachers to get their students more involved. Her career path is especially fascinating, going from an artist, to an audio engineer, to working with students, to working with Amazon Future Engineers on Earsketch, and now to a curriculum developer. Wherever she ends up, I’m sure she will continue to make a positive impact in the world of music technology!
